Dear Reimbursement Officers:

Because of the wrong instruction "sending completed forms
to accountspayable@desu.edu" in the form, I sent the form
to the wrong address, which  was no my  fault.  No one has ever told me the email address has changed and most time I am in
Ningbo campus

Dr. Liu. Helped me to complete the details of the form last year.
He could testify that I prepared the reimbursement on time.

Also, every travel to Ningbo last a whole semester at least because
we are teaching there.

Sincerely

Dear Officers at Invoices@desu.edu:

 

I am faculty member teaching in Ningbo, China campus. I had Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024 and Summer 2024. 

I have sent the reimbursements for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 and my bank information to accountspayable@desu.edu, and  I have never received any

 pay.  Although I received some responses from accountpayable@desu.edu but I was not instructed to send forms  this email account until today when I asked an officers in Administrative building. 

 

The attached was the reimbursement form for Fall 2022.  The next  email is for Spring 2023.

 

Again my bank information is listed below:

 

WSFS Bank

Address: 

500 Delaware Avenue

Wilmington, DE 19801

 

Routing number is  031100102

My account number is 217088814

 

I have to go teaching again from August. So please process my request as soon as possible.  I am waiting for the money to purchase tickets or 

I can not go teach here.  This oversea program brings the university a large revenue  and we don't want to violate the contract.

Dear Financial Officer:

 

Attached please find my reimbursement form together with receipt files(image or PDF).  

My trip for teaching in China started on 09/18/2022 and ended on 12/22/2022. Before this, an  application for travel visa was filed  in August, 2022, that costs some money too.

 

Some receipts have more than one files, such as 8_1 and 8_2.

 

Hardcopies are available upon request.

 

Thank you very much!
