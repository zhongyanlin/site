Instead of roll call, this Attendance add uses member's face image
as id to adminstrate attendance of meetings, classes or any group
activities. Targeted users are teachers, team leaders or organizers
of any informal group actitivities. Analyzing the image
token by user on the  first-time meeting, this app is able to detect
the faces of members and use them as Id to build a  list of group members.
On each meeting later on, user can tap the face icon to take
attendance without remembering people's names or calling
people's name explicitly.
