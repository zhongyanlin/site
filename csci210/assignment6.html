Data Structure and algorithms Assignment 6
 
1. In Java, Queue is a __

a. fully-implemented/completed class
b. interface
c. abstract class


2. We learned two ways for instantiating a queue object. The first
   one is like this
   Queue<SomeClass> q = new ____________<SomeClass>();

3. The second way for instantiating a queue object is
   Queue<SomeClass> q = new _______________<SomeClass>(MAXSIZE,
   new MyComparator());


4. A customized comparison is specified in an
   implementation of _____________ interface which has abstract 
   method "int compare(SomeClass a, SomeClass b)"

5. We learned three kinds of implementations of Linked List:
   (1) Singly linked list without tail as a data member
   (2) Singly linked list with both head and tail as data member
   (3) Doubly linked list with _________________ as data member

6. In order to remove node n from a list, given its previous
   node p and next node x, the code is  __
   a. n.next = x; x.next = null;
   b. p.next = n; n.next = x;
   c. p.next = x; x.next = p;
   d. p.next = x; n.next = null;
   e. x.next = p; p.next = n;


7. If an application needs to impose a cap on the size of a queue,
   then we should use
a. Array List
b. linked list
c. priority Queue
d. circular queue
e. stack


8. If we compare a two-door bus to a FIFO queue, then a one-door
   bus is like __________

9. In a circular queue, when we dequeue an element, how does the front
   position get updated?  front = ________________

10. In a circular queue, when we dequeue an element, the back position
    will never get updated.
 

11. Two essential methods are available in the class Semaphore. One
    is release, and the other _____________

12. How do you declare a hash map to map student's name to Student
    record?
    HashMap<__________,Student> name2student = new HashMap<>();

 
13. In an application development, if we want to store temporarily 
   new records generated at run-time and later on process one by one
    in order, then we use __ to hold records
a. array
b. array list
c. stack
d. priority queue
e. hash table
f. tree set

14. In an application development, if we want to store temporarily 
    new records generated at run-time and later on process them in
    the reverse order, then we use __ to hold records
a. array
b. array list
c. stack
d. priority queue
e. hash table
f. tree set

15. In an application development, if we want to store temporarily 
   the distinct new records generated at run-time and later on process them 
  without worrying about order, then we use __ to hold records
a. array
b. array list
c. stack
d. priority queue
e. hash table
f. tree set

16. The iteration loop for navigating a whole hashtable named H is
    for (KeyClass x : _______){ValueClass y = H.get(x);...}


17. Which data structure supports searching function best?
a. linked list
b. Queue
c. array
d. tree set
e. stack


18. What running time of searching method of Hash table is supposed to be? 
a. O(1) 
b. O(N) 
c. O(log(N))

19. We use linked list to implement Stack and FIFO queue. Is
 it good for implementation of set?


20. What is the running time of insertBefore method in a singly
    linked list with both head and tail as data member? 
a. O(1) 
b. O(N) 
c. O(log(N))
